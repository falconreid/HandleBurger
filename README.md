# Handle Burger Bar

Handle Burger Bar is a 'foodie' app incorporating MVC, Node, JS, MySQL, Express, Handlebars and ORL that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, with the option to show that they've eaten them. The app follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
