# Handle Burger Bar

Handle Burger Bar is a 'foodie' app incorporating MVC, Node, JS, MySQL, Express, Handlebars and ORL that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, with the option to show that they've eaten them. The app follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Details:

- Handle Burger Bar is a restaurant app that lets foodie input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour the Burger!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the "Eaten" side of the page.

- The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## User Story

'Foodies' love to keep track of what they've eaten. As a 'Foodie' who loves burgers, I want to think up new burgers to try and then track when I've eaten them.
